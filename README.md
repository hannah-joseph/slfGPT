# slfGPT


### Purpose
The purpose of this research project to design and implement a custom GPT specialized in Spotted Lanternfly Research (SLF).

## Abstract
The use of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) has opened new ways in using artificial intelligence for a variety of information, ranging from simple to complex. Specifically, it has open ways to generate responses with a focus in scientific research. This project proposes the development of a GPT specialized for Spotted Lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) research, addressing the urgent need for comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date knowledge on this invasive species. The Spotted Lanternfly poses significant threats to agriculture, forestry, and ecosystems in affected regions, needing prompt and effective management strategies. The Spotted Lanternfly Researcher GPT, (SLFR-GPT), is designed to assimilate vast amounts of data from scientific literature, research papers, regulatory guidelines, and real-time monitoring of pest distribution, offering insights into biology, behavior, ecological impact, and control measures of the Spotted Lanternfly. SLFR-GPT enables users to understand simple to complex scientific inquiries, provide detailed and cited information, and suggest management strategies tailored to diverse stakeholders, including homeowners, vineyard operators, and forestry specialists. Through a rigorous training process, the model will incorporate peer-reviewed research papers, expert guidelines, and user-generated content, ensuring it delivers accurate, relevant, and easily understandable responses. This project aims to bridge the gap between advanced scientific research and practical, actionable knowledge for combating the Spotted Lanternflies. By making expert knowledge accessible to a broader audience, the SLFR-GPT will empower communities, policymakers, and researchers to implement more effective control and management practices, contributing to mitigate the environmental and economic impacts of this invasive species. 

### Method
Some of the methods that will be used is AI prompt engineering. Also, creating a Question-Answer knowledge base by compiling research articles and formulating questions with answers will be developed. Fine-tuning the GPT will be used in order to correct information that the GPT outputs.
